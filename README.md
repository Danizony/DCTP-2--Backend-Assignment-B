Even though you are building on the progress of assignment A, this should be treated like another task.

Improve your portfolio page from assignment A by adding:
More tags **might add more tags later 
div
Span
Articles
Add more content to include the following headings:
Summary (about you)
Education (list your past education and certificates)
Job Experiences
Hobby
Other skills
Move the contact form you created in assignment A3 to the bottom of this page
Ensure you add adequate styling using CSS (use all the concepts you have learned about colors and CSS properties, your grading will be based on how much of these concepts you apply eloquently) 
Improve on your assignment A2, by converting the tabulated page to a calculator interface. Your calculator should have:
Numbers 1 to 9
A text field at the top
The following operators
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication ( * )
Division ( / )
Modulus ( % )
Your calculator does not need to function in any way, but ensure you use the right colours for the buttons and the general interface. The goal is to make sure your calculator looks as real as possible
Apply as many of the CSS concepts you have learned as possible
